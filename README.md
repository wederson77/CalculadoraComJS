# CalculatorWithJS
## Calculator developed as an example for the JavaScript Course on Udemy.com. Using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
### In this academic project, I aim to practice concepts such as MVC (Model View Controller), an architectural pattern used to organize and separate the main components of software.
### The MVC pattern seeks to achieve separation of concerns, making the code more organized and easier to maintain. By dividing the application into models (Model), views (View), and controllers (Controller), it becomes possible to make changes in one area without directly affecting the others.

<h2>This paradigm is widely used to create more modular, extensible, and maintainable software, modeling the real world in terms of interacting objects.</h2>
